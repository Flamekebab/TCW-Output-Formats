# The C Word Podcast Output Formats

The name isn't catchy but the idea is a program with a simple GUI (PyQT5) that deals with the finished episodes.

Each time the edit is finished multiple versions of the show need to be output (various codecs, channel counts, and bitrates).
This program should run on most things and handles all that in one step. 

Fire it up, feed it an input file, tell it where the outputted files should end up. Wait.
Once it's done it'll allow you to close it using the button.
